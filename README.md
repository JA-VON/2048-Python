# 2048-Python
My 2048 Game implementation in Python

![Game Screenshot](game_screenshot.png?raw=true "Game Screenshot")

Decided to make this and then use it as an assignment for the students I tutor at the University of the West Indies, Mona, 2016/2017 semester I

It isn't perfect but it was enough to test their knowledge based on the concepts from the curriculum and also gave them a cool project they might want to show off to their friends while introducing them to a few python functions and libraries
they might not have seen in class like deepcopy and the random library. 

Just run the game.py to start my solution for the game. The main.py and the img folder is what they got to start with along with the PDF file with instructions.
